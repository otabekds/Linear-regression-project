## Task
Cleaning and Pre-processing,
Just like we did with Mr Clean, cleaning is one of the first steps after receiving a dataset to explore. Here the dataset was made to be very clean, but just to be sure, let's look for any missing values.

Data Analysis
Now we are ready to cut to the chase. We will see if our supposition was correct by visualizing the data.

Visualization is critical to understanding the relationship between the target and the other features.

A great way to get a feel of the data we are dealing with is to plot each attribute in a histogram.

Prediction
After exploring the data and gaining more insights, the next step is to do another round of data cleaning and find a model to predict the MEDV.

We are going to use a linear regression algorithm from sklearn.


## Description
This project is divided into two parts:
1# Understand the data
2# Build a linear regression prediction model.
House price is a recurring subject nowadays. In this project, I will build a model to predict the price base on predefined criteria.
I used Boston housing prices dataset

## Installation
import pandas
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot 
import seaborn
from sklearn.linear_model import  LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import  mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
from sklearn.datasets import  load_boston  # Import dataset

## Usage
Mean Absolute Error: 4.4477729015322325
Mean Squared Error: 43.60055177116956
Root Mean Squared Error: 6.603071389222561
